__MNIST data:__  around 70,000 handwritten digits in a  28 x 28 images.

The algorithm takes as input an image to determine which number is shown.
This is not a CNN algorithm as we flatten the image into a vector.

__Steps:__<br />
1/ Prepare the data and preprocess it.<br />
2/ Create training, validation and test datasets.<br />
3/ Outline the model and choose the activation functions.<br />
4/ Set the appropriate advanced optimizers and the loss function.<br />
5/ Fit the model.<br />
6/ Test the accuracy of the model.<br />
