MNIST data:  around 70,000 handwritten digits in a  28 x 28 images.

The algorithm takes as input an image to determine which number is shown.
This is not a CNN algorithm as we flatten the image into a vector.

Steps:
1/ Prepare the data and preprocess it.
2/ Create training, validation and test datasets.
3/ Outline the model and choose the activation functions.
4/ Set the appropriate advanced optimizers and the loss function.
5/ Fit the model.
6/ Test the accuracy of the model.
